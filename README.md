# Gym Melee
### Installation
Install this version of dolphin: https://github.com/altf4/dolphin/tree/memorywatcher-rebased, checkout to branch memorywatcher-rebased, compile and install, then create a soft link of the dolphin/installation/path/Build/Binaries directory to $HOME/.local/share/dolphin-emu since libmeele expects the binaries to be there. Make sure the command dolphin-emu is available and if not link the dolphin executable to /usr/local/bin/dolphin-emu.
